#  Cartoonization with GANs**


## Overview

This project focuses on transforming real images into cartoon-style images using a two-part process. The first part utilizes OpenCV to preprocess and generate cartoonized versions of input images. The second part trains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to refine and enhance the cartoon images, producing more accurate and high-quality results.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a cartoonization pipeline that first applies image transformations using OpenCV and then refines the results using a GAN model. By combining traditional computer vision techniques with modern deep learning, the goal is to generate realistic cartoon-style images.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow or PyTorch (for GAN model training)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Other necessary libraries as mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/cartoonization-gan.git
cd cartoonization-gan
```

### Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Part 1: Cartoonization with OpenCV

The first part of the project involves applying image transformations to make the image look like a cartoon using OpenCV. To perform the cartoonization on a single image, use the following script:

```bash
python cartoonize.py --input_image path_to_input_image --output_image path_to_output_image
```

This script will apply filters like edge detection and color quantization to create a cartoon-style image.

### Part 2: Training the GAN Model

To train the GAN model using the cartoonized images, use the following steps:

1. Prepare a dataset of cartoonized images generated by OpenCV.
2. Train the GAN model by running:

   ```bash
python train_gan.py --dataset path_to_cartoon_images --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
```

3. The model will save its progress at regular intervals. To generate new cartoon images, use the trained model by running:

   ```bash
python generate_cartoon.py --input_image path_to_input_image --model_path path_to_trained_model --output_image path_to_output_image
```
